The bsdApiPlugin (Blue Shamrock Development API) is a symfony 1.4 plugin for use as a  
simple turn-key API solution for you symfony 1.4 application. This plugin was originally  
developed for the purpose of providing a RESTful API for some of our products. After  
examining the plugin we decided to share the plugin with the Symfony community
